        <p>Latinos have stories to tell, yet they make up less than 1% of the ones told in Hollywood. As a champion of the Hispanic community McDonald’s wants to help change that. With <strong>Spotlight Dorado</strong>, McDonald’s is giving aspiring Latino filmmakers a chance to participate in a short film competition. Aspiring filmmakers will bring their vision to life having their story produced into a short film with invaluable mentorship from renowned industry leaders and a chance to showcase their film in film festivals around the country.</p>
